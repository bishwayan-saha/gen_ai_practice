       "'Page: Long short-term memory\\nSummary: Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) aimed at mitigating the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered by traditional RNNs. Its relative insensitivity to gap length is its advantage over other RNNs, hidden Markov models, and other sequence learning methods. It aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps (thus \"long short-term memory\"). The name is made in analogy with long-term memory and short-term memory and their relationship, studied by cognitive psychologists since the early 20th century.\\nAn LSTM unit is typically composed of a cell and three gates: an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate. The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals, and the gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell. Forget gates decide what information to discard from the previous state, by mapping the previous state and the current input to a value between 0 and 1. A (rounded) value of 1 signifies retention of the information, and a value of 0 represents discarding. Input gates decide which pieces of new information to store in the current cell state, using the same system as forget gates. Output gates control which pieces of information in the current cell state to output, by assigning a value from 0 to 1 to the information, considering the previous and current states. Selectively outputting relevant information from the current state allows the LSTM network to maintain useful, long-term dependencies to make predictions, both in current and future time-steps.\\nLSTM has wide applications in classification, data processing, time series analysis tasks, speech recognition,  machine translation, speech activity detection, robot control, video games, and healthcare.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Autoregressive moving-average model\\nSummary: In the statistical analysis of time series, autoregressive–moving-average (ARMA) models are a way to describe of a (weakly) stationary stochastic process using autoregression (AR) and a moving average (MA), each with a polynomial. They are a tool for understanding a series and predicting future values. AR involves regressing the variable on its own lagged (i.e., past) values. MA involves modeling the error as a linear combination of error terms occurring contemporaneously and at various times in the past. The model is usually denoted ARMA(p, q), where p is the order of AR and q is the order of MA.\\nThe general ARMA model was described in the 1951 thesis of Peter Whittle, Hypothesis testing in time series analysis, and it was popularized in the 1970 book by George E. P. Box and Gwilym Jenkins.\\nARMA models can be estimated by using the Box–Jenkins method.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Tra'"

       "\"Page: Random matrix\\nSummary: In probability theory and mathematical physics, a random matrix is a matrix-valued random variable—that is, a matrix in which some or all of its entries are sampled randomly from a probability distribution. Random matrix theory (RMT) is the study of properties of random matrices, often as they become large. RMT provides techniques like mean-field theory, diagrammatic methods, the cavity method, or the replica method to compute quantities like traces, spectral densities, or scalar products between eigenvectors. Many physical phenomena, such as the spectrum of nuclei of heavy atoms, the thermal conductivity of a lattice, or the emergence of quantum chaos, can be modeled mathematically as problems concerning large, random matrices.\\n\\nPage: Mixture of experts\\nSummary: Mixture of experts (MoE) is a machine learning technique where multiple expert networks (learners) are used to divide a problem space into homogeneous regions. MoE represents a form of ensemble learning.\\n\\nPage: Microcanonical ensemble\\nSummary: In statistical mechanics, the microcanonical ensemble is a statistical ensemble that represents the possible states of a mechanical system whose total energy is exactly specified. The system is assumed to be isolated in the sense that it cannot exchange energy or particles with its environment, so that (by conservation of energy) the energy of the system does not change with time.\\nThe primary macroscopic variables of the microcanonical ensemble are the total number of particles in the system (symbol: N), the system's volume (symbol: V), as well as the total energy in the system (symbol: E). Each of these is assumed to be constant in the ensemble. For this reason, the microcanonical ensemble is sometimes called the NVE ensemble.\\nIn simple terms, the microcanonical ensemble is defined by assigning an equal probability to every microstate whose energy falls within a range centered at E. All other microstates are given a probability of zero. Since the probabilities must add up to 1, the probability P is the inverse of the number of microstates W within the range of energy,\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        P\\n        =\\n        1\\n        \\n          /\\n        \\n        W\\n        ,\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle P=1/W,}\\n  \\n\\nThe range of energy is then reduced in width until it is infinitesimally narrow, still centered at E. In the limit of this process, the microcanonical ensemble is obtained.\""

      "Summary: Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 8, 2016. The Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former secretary of state and former first lady Hillary Clinton and Virginia junior senator Tim Kaine, in what was considered one of the biggest political upsets in American history. It was the fifth and most recent presidential election in which the winning candidate lost the popular vote. It was also the sixth and most recent presidential election in U.S. history in which both major party candidates were registered in the same home state.\n",
      "Incumbent Democratic president Barack Obama was ineligible to pursue a third term due to the term limits established by the Twenty-second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Clinton secured the nomination over U.S. senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary and became the first female presidential nominee of a major American political party. Initially considered a novelty candidate, Trump emerged as the Republican front-runner, defeating several notable opponents, including U.S. senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, as well as governors John Kasich and Jeb Bush. Trump's right-wing populist, nationalist campaign, which promised to \"Make America Great Again\" and opposed political correctness, illegal immigration, and many United States free-trade agreements, garnered extensive free media coverage due to Trump's inflammatory comments. Clinton emphasized her extensive political experience, denounced Trump and many of his supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\", bigots, and extremists, and advocated the expansion of Obama's policies, racial, LGBT, and women's rights, and inclusive capitalism.\n",
      "The tone of the election campaign was widely characterized as divisive, negative, and troubling. Trump faced controversy over his views on race and immigration, incidents of violence against protesters at his rallies, and numerous sexual misconduct allegations including the Access Hollywood tape. Clinton's popularity and public image were tarnished by concerns about her ethics and trustworthiness, and a controversy and subsequent FBI investigation regarding her improper use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, which received more media coverage than any other topic during the campaign. Clinton led in almost every nationwide and swing-state poll, with some predictive models giving Clinton over a 90 percent chance of victory.\n",
      "On election day, Trump over-performed his polls, winning several key swing states, while losing the popular vote by 2.87 million votes. Trump received the majority in the Electoral College and won upset victories in the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The pivotal victory in this region, which Trump won by fewer than 80,000 votes in the three states with the combined 46 electoral votes, was the catalyst that won him the Electoral College vote. Trump's surprise victories were perceived to have been assisted by Clinton's lack of campaigning in the region, the rightward shift of the white working class, and the influence of Sanders–Trump voters who chose to back Donald Trump after Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primaries. Ultimately, Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton 227, as two faithless electors defected from Trump and five from Clinton. Trump flipped six states that had voted Democratic in 2012: Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as Maine's 2nd congressional district. Trump was the first president with neither prior public service nor military experience.\n",
      "With ballot access to the entire national electorate, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes (3.27%), the highest nationwide vote share for a third-party candidate since Ross Perot in 1996, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein received almost 1.4\u001b[0m\n",
